## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- bootstrap

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Outfit";
  src: url(https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit);
}
/* for custom font but it didn't use in the project because it didn't match the design. */

div{
  height: 100vh;
}
/* for positioning the div element in non-scrolling page */

```

```bootstrap
<div class="position-relative">
  <div class="position-absolute top-50 start-50 translate-middle">
    position the element
  </div>
</div>


<div class="fixed-bottom">
  to stick to the bottom
</div>

```

### Continued development

I want to practice on page layouts and widths/heights.
